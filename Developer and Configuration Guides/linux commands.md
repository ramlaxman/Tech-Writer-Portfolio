To make Windows Time synchronize with NTP server

Stop the W32Time service with : C:\>net stop w32time
Configure the external NTP server by  typing : C:\> w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist: 0.centos.pool.ntp.org
Then make your  PDC a reliable NTP server with  C:\>w32tm /config /reliable:yes
Start the w32time service with : C:\>net start w32time
You can check the NTP servers configuration by typing: C:\>w32tm /query /configuration
Next thing I decided to do was to automate the time sync, since I didnâ€™t want to rely on Windows to do it.
Command for that is pretty simple : c:\w32tm /resync
