# What is DevOps

## DevOps Quest
Today almost every engineer is familiar with this word but few of them know the crux of it. The interviews, that I read online and my friends told me about, give idea that organization looking for DevOps roles are 
missing the basic instinct of it. Most of the interviewers focus on python programming concepts or AWS solution architect questions, judge candidate from these questions. Real story for need of a DevOps engineer is quite different.

## What in actual DevOps is?

DevOps is a type of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Many people argue on this but if you look at its phases, it covers all stages from planning to release covered in other types of SDLC like agile, waterfall. In simple  words, you need to understand all tools and technologies that contribute in software development process.

For example, let's see phase of planning. For this, you must know how to use git, how to send and update commits between git client and github.com. In short, you need to have knowledge of git in terms of GUI and CLI as well to master the planning phase. In similar way, you need to learn about several tools and technologies related to other phases.

In summary, it is simple yet persistence is required to get into DevOps. Following are my recommendations if you're getting into DevOps:

- Plan - Version Control Systems like Git, Mercurial, Bitbucket.
  
- Code - Python is preferred still one can use Shell and Golang.

- Build - Ant, Maven like frameworks.

- Test - Selenium, testing framework or Pytest like native test library.

- Release - Jenkins, CI/CD tool or AWS Pipeline like web services. 

- Deploy - Ansible or Chef like infrastructure automation tools

- Operate - Docker or K8s for infrastructural operations

- Monitor - Nagios like infrastructure monitoring tool


## DevOps is not:

- Python Developer who'll learn all tools overnight
- Software engineer trying to become Site Reliability Engineer
- Someone who knows about architecting AWS components but not about on-premise tools
- Someone who can't pickup operational part quickly and effectively
- One who is not interested in system administration and only writing the code.

A career shift

Here are a few things you should do to begin positioning yourself as a DevOps engineer.

Interview at a company that's hiring DevOps. If you get hired, you'll learn the operations side of things fast. Real fast. Or get fired. If you don't get hired, you'll learn what is still missing from your resume / experience that's preventing you from becoming a full-time DevOps engineer. Incidentally, we're hiring: Keep Austin Bazaar
Tell your boss you want to become a DevOps engineer at your company. Your boss should help you to this end. If he/she does not, quit. Then come work at Bazaarvoice with me and a bunch of other really awesome, super talented engineers working on some really awesome and challenging problems.
Obtain practical experience by using your skills as a software engineer to build tools rather than software. Look at any of the open source projects Netflix has written for examples / ideas.
Learn OpenStack. You can do this on your own time and budget. It's not important whether OpenStack sucks compared to Rackspace Cloud. What's important is that you understand all of the various components and why they are important. Have a wad of cash lying around? Learn Amazon Web Services instead.
Participate in anything your team does involving operations -- deployment, scale, etc. (See list above: "What DevOps is.") If your team doesn't do any of that (i.e., they send artifacts over to Operations and the Operations team does deployment), go over to the Operations team and sit in on a few deployments.

Do I need to have deep operations experience to become a good devops engineer?

I've asked myself the same question. I come from a development background myself and only had less than a year of experience dealing with operations before becoming a DevOps engineer. (Granted, I had a referral vouching for me, which I believe weighed in my favor.) Despite my less-than-stellar algorithmic skills (based on my complete lack of formal computer science education -- I've never taken a technical computing class in my life, in college or otherwise), I've had enough experience writing software that I could apply these concepts to systems in a similar fashion. That is, in the same way a software engineer needs to understand at what point his application code should be abstract to avoid future technical debt (i.e., refactoring), a DevOps engineer needs to understand at what point a component of his infrastructure should be abstract to avoid future technical debt (i.e., rebuilding all of his servers and rearchitecting infrastructure that's already in production). At its core, a good engineer is just as good whether he's writing software or deploying it. Understanding complex systems and intuitively how their interactions affect each other is critical.

I hope this answer helps you in your endeavor to become a DevOps engineer. You should get your feet wet with some of the things we do. If it gets you tingly and excited, then come work for Bazaarvoice with me. (And this goes for anyone reading this answer. Austin doesn't seem to have enough DevOps engineers!) Now go kick some butt! Good luck!
