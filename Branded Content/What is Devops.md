# What is DevOps

## About this article

This article is targeted for organizational approach towards DevOps and bridging the gap between expectations and variance in DevOps role.

## Role of DevOps

Today, almost every computer engineer is familiar with the term DevOps but only some of them know the crux of it. What I know from the candidates' interview experiences, which are posted online and discussed with DevOps engineers, is organizations are somehow missing the basic ideology. That's why most of the interviewers are focusing only on either python programming or AWS solution architect questions to test and evaluate knowledge of the candidates while the real story is a bit different.

## What should be the DevOps?

It can be defined as *DevOps is a set of practices, including both development and operational aspects for managing the infrastructure, which helps to achieve agility in dynamic environment for rapid and sustainable software development.* In simple terms, DevOps is a type of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Its phases ranges from `plan` to `release` similar to that of Agile, Waterfall. Here, interesting thing is one can use and modify required phases of DevOps life cycle as per need of the project.

Generally, phases in DevOps are `plan`, `code`, `build`, `test`, `release`, `operate` and `monitor`. For example, in the phase of `planning`, you must know how to use Git, how to send and update commits between Git client and `GitHub.com`. In short, you need to have knowledge of git in terms of GUI and CLI to master the `planning` phase. In similar way, you need to learn about several tools and technologies related to other phases.

In simple words, you need to understand all tools and technologies that are associated with software development process during DevOps.

It is simple but persistence efforts are required to acquire the skill-sets for DevOps role. 

You can check some recommendations if you're getting into DevOps:

- **Plan** - Version Control Systems like `Git`, `Mercurial`, `Bitbucket` etc
  
- **Code** - `Python` is preferred still one should also know `Shell` and `Golang`

- **Build** - `Ant`, `Maven` like frameworks

- **Test** - `Selenium` like testing framework or `Pytest` like native test library

- **Release** - `Jenkins` like CI/CD tool or `AWS CodePipeline` like web services for release management

- **Deploy** - `Ansible` or `Chef` like infrastructure automation tools

- **Operate** - `Docker` or `K8s` (Kubernetes) for infrastructural operations

- **Monitor** - `Nagios` for infrastructure monitoring tool


## DevOps is not

- Python Developer who'll learn all tools overnight
- Software engineer trying to become Site Reliability Engineer
- Someone who knows about architecting AWS components but not about on-premise tools
- Someone who can't pickup operational part quickly and effectively
- One who is not interested in system administration and only writing the code.

## What does DevOps engineer do?

DevOps engineer cares about SDLC and its principles rather than just learning the tools. For example, if some developer needs to test new software over mongodb for which you don't have dedicated infrastructure available due to budget restrictions but clients needs to check fault tolerance of that application. In such a case, Docker comes to the rescue. Launching multiple Docker containers on cloud based or on-premise infrastructure help to understand fault tolerance of that application. In this case, DevOps engineer should follow practice of 


Here are a few things you should do to begin positioning yourself as a DevOps engineer.

Interview at a company that's hiring DevOps. If you get hired, you'll learn the operations side of things fast. Real fast. Or get fired. If you don't get hired, you'll learn what is still missing from your resume / experience that's preventing you from becoming a full-time DevOps engineer. Incidentally, we're hiring: Keep Austin Bazaar
Tell your boss you want to become a DevOps engineer at your company. Your boss should help you to this end. If he/she does not, quit. Then come work at Bazaarvoice with me and a bunch of other really awesome, super talented engineers working on some really awesome and challenging problems.
Obtain practical experience by using your skills as a software engineer to build tools rather than software. Look at any of the open source projects Netflix has written for examples / ideas.
Learn OpenStack. You can do this on your own time and budget. It's not important whether OpenStack sucks compared to Rackspace Cloud. What's important is that you understand all of the various components and why they are important. Have a wad of cash lying around? Learn Amazon Web Services instead.
Participate in anything your team does involving operations -- deployment, scale, etc. (See list above: "What DevOps is.") If your team doesn't do any of that (i.e., they send artifacts over to Operations and the Operations team does deployment), go over to the Operations team and sit in on a few deployments.

Do I need to have deep operations experience to become a good devops engineer?

I've asked myself the same question. I come from a development background myself and only had less than a year of experience dealing with operations before becoming a DevOps engineer. (Granted, I had a referral vouching for me, which I believe weighed in my favor.) Despite my less-than-stellar algorithmic skills (based on my complete lack of formal computer science education -- I've never taken a technical computing class in my life, in college or otherwise), I've had enough experience writing software that I could apply these concepts to systems in a similar fashion. That is, in the same way a software engineer needs to understand at what point his application code should be abstract to avoid future technical debt (i.e., refactoring), a DevOps engineer needs to understand at what point a component of his infrastructure should be abstract to avoid future technical debt (i.e., rebuilding all of his servers and rearchitecting infrastructure that's already in production). At its core, a good engineer is just as good whether he's writing software or deploying it. Understanding complex systems and intuitively how their interactions affect each other is critical.

I hope this answer helps you in your endeavor to become a DevOps engineer. You should get your feet wet with some of the things we do. If it gets you tingly and excited, then come work for Bazaarvoice with me. (And this goes for anyone reading this answer. Austin doesn't seem to have enough DevOps engineers!) Now go kick some butt! Good luck!
