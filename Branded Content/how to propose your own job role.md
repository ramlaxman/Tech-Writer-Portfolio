Recently I've applied at one of education oriented company of Maharashtra state government. It's been a great experience to propose your own job role for such a esteemed position.

Dear ______ Sir,  

This is Mayur S. Patil, ME Computer Engineering. I’m working as Assistant Professor from 6+ years in an Engineering College at Pune. I know you don’t have much spare time to read a letter from a complete stranger but I've to reach out to a torchbearer, especially one with the sort of career that you have. I request your __ minutes for the same.

> You can mention name of referral so it'll be easy for them to get know you better.

I approached Mr or Ms _______ , Organization, Product in New Exponential Technologies, Educational transformation, for a job opportunity. He/She advised that I should go through your lectures and summarize the challenges that have been addressed in order to find a role appealing for my passion. I want to mention following challenges that you've addressed:

- Enthusiasm for Innovation
- Digital Divide
- Continuous and sufficient bandwidth
- Lack of proper resources for digital classroom
- Unavailability of IT admins 

I would like to propose the following solutions as per my research:

## Enthusiasm for innovation (as per one point in a speech)

Developing and curating contents as per demand of industry and education is as important as teaching the students. Mainstream technical courses creation like Open Source, Cloud Computing certifications, Python Programming and its Application for students from non programmers, who have literally no background in that technology, to college students of technical faculty in order to bring job readiness.

## Different Learning Styles (addresses challenge of Digital Divide)

There is an immense need to create different curriculum structures for the MSCIT course. One course should be developed with different learning styles such as pedagogy, andragogy. As per my survey, when I discussed with some adult learners, some of them told that either for the sake of completion or  lack of compelling and compatible content, they drop idea to appear for MSCIT certification exam. This points out the fact that the same shoe does not fit every foot.

## Different Learning Method (addresses challenge of Digital Divide)

VARK methods are the need of an hour.

## Curriculum Upgrade (as per Annual Report 19-20 Pt. 7.0 to maintain competency):

I'd also want to contribute towards making MKCL certification courses more competent and favorable for self learning platforms like Coursera, NPTEL. [More like Coursera as most of the students fell asleep during NPTEL lectures due to the length of lectures and presentation style.]

## Wider and Deeper (Mission Objectives of Organization):

As a professor, I also observed engineering students, their parents or even other discipline students they only know about MSCIT compared to other courses from MKCL. I want to breathe fresh air into the MSCIT curriculum by trying learning methodologies to bring a better approach to the existing certification system. For ex, tips of google search engine, general use of open source softwares  etc. So, it’ll remain subject of interest for both beginner and advanced learners.

## AWS Direct Connect (addressing last 3 challenges)

As the Government of Maharashtra is already investing in AWS services, one of their fantastic web services is `AWS Direct Connect`. In addition to meticulous efforts put by ___________, this will add cherry on the top by eliminating the need of hardware to carry around. Here, the AWS solution architecture for the reference that I’ve designed.

```
"It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with the experiment, it's wrong."

― Richard P. Feynman.
```

I always test the waters of theoretical concepts with lots of hands on practice in order to breathe life into my curriculum and teaching. Also, to check whether theoretical concepts are feasible for my students or not.
In these 7+ years, I've worked on various job roles most of them were freelancing. I believe with your mentoring and my hard work I can make it happen. When I’ve gone through various certification courses over Klik MKCL, I was wondering and curious how come there is no single course on Cloud Computing. Hence, I decided to approach you for a full time position of “___________________”. I believe that I can do justice to this position because of my consistent work and passion for Computer Science.

Other Credentials:

- Experience in Learning Styles: Excellent understanding of pedagogy, andragogy and heutagogy.

- PMKVY: Moderate curriculum and teach students of PMKVY (Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana) for the post of software developers.

- Subject Matter Expert: Amazon Web Service Subject Matter Expert Item Writing Training Course with 92%.

- ICT Tools: Excellent Hands on Knowledge of following platform and ability to conduct various assessments:

	- Moodle

	- Google Classroom

	- GitHub Classroom

	- Microsoft Teams

I've strong understanding and unrelenting passion for the roles: Open Source, Cloud Computing, Python, Operating System, NoSQL Databases.

Practical Experience:
- Technical Training:

	- Amazon India Bangalore and Hyderabad for 8 days freelance.

	- Fedora Conference 2015 on Linux kernel and GitHub.

	- AWS Solution Architect SAA C02 for 3 Days.

	- Openstack, Firefox, Python in GNUNify.

	- GitHub for DevOps for 1 Day.
 
- Deployment for Cloud Platforms:

	**Public**

	Experience in solution architecture on a freelance basis.

	Design and execute software architecture for grant based projects.

	Define and manage security groups.
	
	Setup storage services for media storage and website data
	
	Troubleshoot and scale instances.
	
	Implement Load balancers to reduce downtime.

So, I thought even if there is a chance to make this job happen, why hold this back?

This is my side of the story. I have put all my cards on the table. 

As there is no recruitment for experienced professional going on at ______ , I don’t want to regret later that I didn’t reach out to you earlier to give me a chance to make an impact on peoples’ lives.

At the very last, appreciate your valuable time and I’ll wait for your reply to consider me for suitable job role.

Thank You !
