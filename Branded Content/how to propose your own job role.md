Dear Ajay Sir,
This is Mayur S. Patil, ME Computer Engineering. I’m working as Assistant Professor from 6+ in an Engineering College at Pune. I know you don’t have much spare time to read a letter from a complete stranger, but I just had to reach out to a torchbearer, especially one with the sort of career that you have. I request your __ minutes for the same.
I approached Mr Sachin Dandekar, MKCL, Product in New Exponential Technologies, Educational transformation, for a job opportunity. He advised that I should go through your lectures, summarize and jot down the challenges that you addressed in order to find a role appealing for my passion. 
I want to mention the following are some of the challenges that you've addressed: 
Enthusiasm for Innovation
Digital Divide
Continuous and sufficient bandwidth
Lack of proper resources for digital classroom
Unavailability of IT admins 
I would like to propose the following solutions (as per the research):
Different Learning Styles:  (addresses challenge of Digital Divide)
There is an immense need to create different curriculum structures for the MSCIT course. One should be pedagogy oriented and other should be andragogy etc. As per my survey, when I discussed with some adult learners, few of them accepted that, for the sake of their completion or lack of compelling and compatible content, they drop MSCIT certification in the middle. Also, I humbly want to suggest that the same shoe does not fit every foot. 
Different Learning Methods: (addresses challenge of Digital Divide)
VARK methods are the need of an hour.
Enthusiasm for innovation: (as per one point in a speech)
Developing and curating contents as per demand of industry and education from a learning and understanding point of view for our students. Mainstream technical courses like Open Source, Cloud Computing certifications, Python Programming and its Application for students from non programmers, who have literally no background in that technology to final year students of technical branches in order to bring Job Readiness.
Curriculum Upgradation: (as per Annual Report 19-20 Pt. 7.0 to maintain competency)
I want to contribute to make MKCL certification courses more competent and favorable for self learning like Coursera, NPTEL. [More like Coursera as I literally fall asleep during NPTEL lectures due to the length of lectures and presentation style. Pun intended.]
Wider and Deeper: (Mission Objectives of MKCL)
As a professor, I also observed engineering students, their parents or even other discipline students they only know about MSCIT compared to other courses from MKCL. I want to breathe fresh air into the MSCIT curriculum by trying learning methodologies to bring a better approach to the existing certification system. For ex, tips of google search engine, general use of open source softwares  etc. So, it’ll remain subject of interest to beginner as well as advanced learners.
AWS Direct Connect (addressing last 3 challenges)
As the Government of Maharashtra is already using AWS services, one of their fantastic web services is Direct Connect. In addition to meticulous efforts put by Team Supercampus, this will add cherry on the top by eliminating the need of hardware to carry around. Here, the AWS solution architecture for the reference that I’ve designed:
 
As per famous physicist Richard Feymann quotes "It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with the experiment, it's wrong."
― Richard P. Feynman.
I always test the waters of theoretical concepts with lots of hands on practice in order to breathe life into my curriculum and teaching. Also, to check whether theoretical concepts are feasible for my students or not.
In these 7+ years, I've worked on various job roles most of them were freelancing. Frankly speaking, I don't know what is the exact job requirement at MKCL right now. I believe with your mentoring and my hard work I can make it happen.
When I’ve gone through various certification courses over Klik MKCL, I was wondering and curious how come there is no single course on Cloud Computing. Hence, I decided to approach you for a full time position of “Technical Curriculum Development - Cloud Computing and Open Source”. I believe that I can do justice to this position because of my consistent work and passion for Cloud Computing.

Best Practices for Writing a New Position Proposal
Identify the problem your job proposal solves. If there are multiple issues the position would solve, write them all in your rough draft. You might decide to remove some points or add something during the writing and editing process.
Do your research and detail the reasons this gap needs a new position created to fill it. Don't assume your boss already knows why this new position is needed. When you present the facts in an organized way, it shines a light on the issue and why there's a need to do something about it.
Also, try to determine if other similar organizations have the type of position you are proposing. If so, gather as much data as possible to build your case. And even if your search is fruitless, you are building your network by conducting the research. Perhaps other more interesting opportunities may arise from it, which means you should know how to update your resume.
List the ways your unique skill set makes you the ideal candidate to fill the new position. Hopefully your boss already knows you're great at what you do, but is she or he aware of other skills you have? This is your chance to exhibit your otherwise hidden talents and your potential value to the company.
Sell yourself for the position when listing your skills. Add examples of times when you have performed above expectations, within the company, while doing volunteer work, and in your personal life.
Be concise when writing this type of proposal. According to US News and World Report, keeping your pitch to one page shows the people considering your proposal you value their time. When you keep it brief, you also have the opportunity to hone in on the specifics that would make you successful at the new position.
Use bold text in the title, subheadings, and bullet points to make it easy for your boss to quickly review the important points in your pitch.
Thank your boss for taking the time to review your proposal and restate your interest in filling the position.

Dear Ms. Smith,
Due to the ongoing challenges within our scheduling department, I’d like to propose the creation of a new position at ABC, Inc.: Scheduling Coordinator.
According to my research, our automatic scheduling system creates some challenges for the company in terms of overtime use and staff turnover. The work schedule is only released a week in advance, which prevents employees from knowing their upcoming shifts within an adequate amount of time to plan their personal schedules. As a result, they often need to swap shifts or find coverage at the last minute, and employees who cover shifts risk accruing higher amounts of overtime. This inconsistent scheduling is one of the leading reasons for high staff turnover and low employee satisfaction rates at ABC, Inc.
The data I collected on both negative impacts include:
Excessive overtime costs totaling over $115,000 per year.
60% of employees who quit over the last three years cited uneven shift distribution as their top reason for leaving the company.
The addition of a scheduling coordinator position would directly address these issues. In this role, I would ensure even shift distribution and reduce overtime costs by over $100,000 per year. Unlike an automatic scheduling system, I can communicate directly with employees to provide the best shifts based on their individual availability. 
This flexible system will lead to better employee attendance along with higher employee satisfaction and lower staff turnover rates. The annual cost of the automated system would also be eliminated, which offsets the salary of the new position.
My duties as the scheduling coordinator would include:
Organizing and preparing work schedules in advance to avoid swapping shifts
Managing shift coverage while avoiding overtime hours when possible
Accommodating scheduling conflicts
Tracking employee attendance records including vacation time and sick leave
Approving and scheduling time off for employees
Verifying weekly employee hours worked for payroll
I have worked for ABC, Inc. for nearly seven years in a variety of staff positions. I am, therefore, familiar with many company policies that affect staff scheduling. My qualifications for the scheduling coordinator position include: 
Written and verbal communication skills for discussing shift preferences with staff
Critical-thinking skills to flag potential issues and report them to upper management 
Organizational skills to ensure proper documentation is filed and shift coverage is sufficient in each department
Record-keeping skills to ensure employee preferences are updated regularly to prevent conflicts
Proficiency in Microsoft Office programs to track employee attendance and time off 
Team-building skills to maintain amicable relationships with employees and management personnel to better handle staff concerns
Thank you for taking the time to review this proposal for a new Scheduling Coordinator position. I believe that this role will allow me to put my skills and qualifications to use in order to benefit the company and improve employee retention. Please contact me if you have any other questions about my proposal. I look forward to discussing the opportunity with you further.
Sincerely,
Linda Jones
